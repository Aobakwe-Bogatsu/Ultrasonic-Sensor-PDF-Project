# Ultrasonic-Sensor-PDF-Project
This project investigates the **accuracy and consistency of a standard hobby ultrasonic sensor**, collects distance data across various ranges, and visualises it using a **Probability Density Function (PDF)**. The project was developed and simulated using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and analyzed using **Processing**.
